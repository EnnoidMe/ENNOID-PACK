# ENNOID-PACK

This project aims to create a scalable & modular lithium-ion battery packs based on cylindrical cell format.

## Features:

- Cylindrical cells, 12S10P modular modules
- 1,5kWh modules can be stacked in parallels & series
- Integrated thermistor, cell voltages & temperature monitoring connectors for BMS are soldered onto the PCB
- Cells electrodes are spotwelded directly onto the PCB
- ISOSPI communication toward master BMS board
- Individually fused cylindrical cells
- Sealed, isolated & robust casing
- Integrated with ENNOID-BMS for voltages & temperatures monitoring
